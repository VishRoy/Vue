# Vue

Vue is a framework which kind of sits between React and Angular. It’s not as “big” as Angular but it definitely includes more features than React does. Vue does give you built-in state management and it also ships with a built-in router. It does, however, not include form validation or Http client functionalities.

Just like Angular and React, the core of Vue is all about building user interfaces by combining re-usable components. But beyond that, it gives you a bit more than React and a bit less than Angular.
